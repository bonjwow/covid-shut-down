#### Pie Chart ####
### Import cleaned business licences dataset
dfCleanBiz <- readr::read_csv("../../inputs/data/clean_business_licences.csv")
### Create data frame
dfBoroughs <- data.frame(
  group = dfCleanBiz$fsa,
  value = dfCleanBiz$n
)
### Calculate percentages
dfBoroughs <- dfBoroughs %>% 
  arrange(desc(group)) %>%
  mutate(prop = value / sum(dfBoroughs$value) *100) %>%
  mutate(ypos = cumsum(prop)- 0.5*prop ) %>%
  arrange(desc(prop))
# print(dfBoroughs)
### Create pie chart
