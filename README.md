## About The Project

The purpose of this project was to examine the effects shutting down indoor dining services and switching restaurants to a take-out/delivery only based business model in light of COVID-19 restrictions in Toronto. Results were written up based on survey [data](https://github.com/bonjwow/covid-shut-down/blob/main/inputs/data/simulated_data.csv) simulated in R. A pdf of the final report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/bonjwow/covid-shut-down/blob/main/outputs/paper/paper.pdf).
